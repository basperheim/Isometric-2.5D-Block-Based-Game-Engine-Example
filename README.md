## Overview

This repository contains a simple proof-of-concept game engine implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The engine provides a 2.5D isometric perspective for creating block-based games.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library (`pip3 install pygame`)

## Features

- Isometric view: The engine renders a 2.5D isometric perspective for creating visually appealing games.
- Block-based terrain: The terrain consists of blocks with different types, including dirt, grass, rocky, urban, and water.
- Camera control: Use keyboard controls (arrow keys or WASD) to move the camera and navigate the game world.
- Zoom control: Zoom in and out of the game world using keyboard shortcuts (- and + keys) or mouse scroll.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Isometric-2.5D-Block-Based-Game-Engine-Example.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Isometric-2.5D-Block-Based-Game-Engine-Example
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install pygame
```

4. Run the game:

```bash
python3 isoterrain.py
```

5. Explore the game world and experiment with camera and zoom controls to navigate the terrain.
